# Caesar Cipher Encoder
This is a small web-based project about Caesar cipher encoding. It allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages using a Caesar cipher.

To encrypt a message, simply enter the message and the key into the form and click the "Encrypt" button. The encrypted message will be displayed in the output field.

To decrypt a message, enter the encrypted message and the key into the form and click the "Decrypt" button. The decrypted message will be displayed in the output field.

## Key Features

Encrypts and decrypts messages using a Caesar cipher
Supports messages of any length
Secure and reliable
Usage
To use the Caesar cipher encoder, simply visit the website and enter the following:

The message you want to encrypt or decrypt
The key for the Caesar cipher
Once you have entered this information, click the "Encrypt" or "Decrypt" button to perform the operation.
